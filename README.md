# WordsInContext
This project helps practicing understanding foreign words in spoken context.

## THE GOAL
- The user enters a word in foreign language that they want to practice, and the app finds this word in a sentence context in a complete sentence, and then reads out this in word in as many different sentences as the user chooses, with transcription on the screen. 
- The user can pause, seek and skip between sentences.
- These sentences will be statements, questions, and exclamations to hear different intonations.

## THE TECH
- Sentences are taken from books for high quality, typo-free redacted content.
- The sentences are read back using text-to-speech (various providers), or by seeking a spoken excerpt in audio books.
- There will be a Web app, and later iOS/Android (Xamarin) app.
